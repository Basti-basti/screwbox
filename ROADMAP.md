- add A*-Pathfinding Algorithm (as default)
- particle emitters
- engine.options().apply(Optionset optionset)
- engine.quick() -> for common used actions
- assets project for sounds / graphics and non default systems
- system priority via annotation @Order(Simulation)
- preload resources via reflection and classloader as @Asset
- light -> full brightness without blur setting
